# running the code
Must have Python installed, but the packages used are all built-in

In order to run the code, open the console in this directory and run (feel free to copy paste and change the values):

`python package_sorter.py --height 10 --width 10 --length 10 --mass 10`


If you wish to run the unit tests, run this command instead:

`python test_sort.py`
